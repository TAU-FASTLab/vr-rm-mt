# **VR-RM-MT: Virtual reality set for robot and machine monitoring and training** 

## About VR-RM-MT

The main functionality of this component is to enable the training and support of human workers in collaborative tasks. For doing so, the main activities of the collaborative task and the interaction of worker and robot is created in Virtual Reality (VR). By using a virtual reality headset and equipment the worker can remotely visualize, monitor and perform the training of collaborative tasks with robots.  It should be noted that based on the use case requirements (e.g., workspace and environment, equipment, safety aspects and interfaces to other components), several data inputs might be needed for creation of custom simulations. The component is divided into a sandbox mode (using pre-programmed actions) and a dynamic mode, which depending on configuration could receive data inputs from ROS nodes for on-the-fly creation of tasks.
